# Enterprise Risk Register & Dashboard (Excel + Power BI)

## Overview
This project is an **Operations & Analytics** build designed to mirror an enterprise workflow for tracking operational risks and mitigation actions across a portfolio.

It includes:
- A structured **risk register**
- A standardized **mitigation action tracker**
- A dashboard for **executive-level reporting**
- Built-in logic for **overdue flags**, filtering, and trend visibility

All data is **synthetic** and created solely for portfolio/demo purposes.

---

## Key Features

### Risk Register + Action Tracker (Excel)
- Standardized fields for consistent data entry (risk category, severity, likelihood, owner, status, review date)
- Clear structure linking: **Risks → Actions → Owners → Review Dates**
- Overdue tracking using conditional logic and status fields
- Designed for filtering and audit-friendly review

### Executive Dashboard (Power BI)
- Summary of:
  - Top residual risks
  - Overdue mitigation actions
  - Risk trends over time
- Built to support decision-making and operational prioritization

## Key Insights 

> *Note: Insights are based on synthetic demo data designed to reflect realistic operational risk patterns.*

- **Overdue mitigation actions are concentrated in a small number of high-severity risks**, suggesting bottlenecks in follow-through rather than a lack of tracking.
- **A recurring set of risk categories contributes disproportionately to residual risk**, indicating that certain operational areas require targeted process controls.
- **Risks with unclear ownership or missing review dates are more likely to remain open longer**, reducing accountability and making status reporting less reliable.
- **Mitigation actions with long target timelines are more likely to become overdue**, implying a need for milestone-based tracking rather than single due dates.
- **Risk status changes are not evenly distributed over time**, which suggests updates may be occurring in batches rather than through continuous review.

---

## Process Improvements

- **Standardize required fields** (Owner, Review Date, Risk Category, Severity) using validation rules to reduce incomplete entries and improve reporting accuracy.
- **Implement an “Overdue Escalation” workflow** (e.g., weekly review or automated flagging) to prevent overdue actions from accumulating unnoticed.
- **Introduce a “High Residual Risk Review” checklist** for risks above a defined threshold to ensure consistent mitigation planning and sign-off.
- **Add milestone tracking for long-term mitigation actions** (e.g., 25% / 50% / 75% checkpoints) to reduce missed deadlines and improve visibility.
- **Create a monthly executive summary view** that highlights:
  - Top residual risks  
  - Overdue actions by owner  
  - Risks without review dates  
  - Category-level trends

## Data Quality Notes

- All fields are standardized for consistent entry (category, severity, likelihood, owner, status, review date).
- Built-in logic supports:
  - overdue flagging  
  - consistent filtering  
  - audit-friendly review tracking  
- All data is synthetic and intended for portfolio/demo purposes only.

## Why This Project
Operations teams rely on documentation, compliance tracking, and structured checklists to ensure consistency across multiple sites. This project reflects that workflow through:
- portfolio visibility  
- accountability by owner  
- audit-ready organization  
- consistent reporting  

---

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** (structured tracking, validation logic, overdue flags)
- **Power BI** (dashboard reporting + KPI summaries)

---

## Files Included
- `Transport_Project.xlsx` — risk register and mitigation tracker  
- `Transit_Risk_Dashboard.pbix` — Power BI dashboard file (if included)  
- `Transit_Visual1, Transit_Visual2` — preview images of the tracker + dashboard  

---

## Notes
- All content uses **synthetic data** (no company or confidential information).
- This project is intended to demonstrate operational documentation, tracking, and reporting skills.
